# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
> a tech support/coding wiki by [KraXen72](https://github.com/KraXen72)
  
basically each time i encourtered a noteworthy problem i solved, i made a small note how i did it. this is what came from it.  
## notes
- the sidebars are generated by a script in the root folder, cause [vitepress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) sidebar is not automatic for whatever reason.
  - make sure to run `sidebar-generator.js` with node when making/editing/removing some files/folders
- the algolia doc search does not work because i cannot be bothered. use `Ctrl + F`
  
## suggestions
- feel free to just **bookmark** this and check it if desperate sometime in the future
- also, feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/KraXen72/tech-support-wiki/pulls) when you solve some issue/have an idea what could fit here. i'll most likely merge it
	- you can use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to edit the `docs` folder
  
### contribution guidelines
- put all images in `docs/public` and reference them as `![alt_text](/image.png)`
- images & notes should **NOT** contain spaces.
- notes should have them replaced with `-`, as in `note title` => `note-title`
- images should have them replaced with `_`, as in `my cool image.png` => `my_cool_image.png`
- run with `npm run dev` for development
- to test the site, run `npm run build` and `npm run preview`.
  
### TODO
- write a script to resolve & convert obsidian image/note links to vitepress/commonmark alternatives
