# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
> a tech support/coding wiki by [KraXen72](https://github.com/KraXen72)
  
when i encounter some pesky problem i eventually solve, i make a small note how i did it, to save the next person (possibly myself in the future) some suffering.  

## suggestions
- feel free to just **bookmark** this and check it if desperate sometime in the future
- also, feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/KraXen72/tech-support-wiki/pulls) when you solve some issue/have an idea what could fit here. i'll most likely merge it
	- you can use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to edit the `docs` folder
  
## notes
- the sidebars are generated by a script in the root folder, cause [vitepress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) sidebar is not automatic for whatever reason.
  - make sure to run `sidebar-generator.js` with node when making/editing/removing some files/folders 
  
### YouTube embeds
- i had ChatGPT write a simple YouTube embed vue component (i don't know any Vue).
- use it like this:
	```html
	<script setup>
		import Youtube from '../Youtube.vue';
	</script>
	<Youtube videoId="tD5NrevFtbU"/>

	# Markdown
	```
  
### contribution guidelines
- put all images in `docs/public` and reference them as `![alt_text](/image.png)`, or in the folder and import relatively
- images & notes should **NOT** contain spaces.
- notes should have them replaced with `-`, as in `note title` => `note-title`
- images should have them replaced with `_`, as in `my cool image.png` => `my_cool_image.png`
- run with `npm run dev` for development
- to test the site, run `npm run build` and `npm run preview`.
