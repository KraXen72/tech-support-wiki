basically each time i encourtered a noteworthy problem i solved, i made a small note how i did it.  
this is what came from it.

## notes
- the sidebars are generated by a script in the root folder, cause [vitepress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) sidebar is not automatic for whatever reason.
- the algolia doc search does not work because i cannot be bothered. use `Ctrl + F`
