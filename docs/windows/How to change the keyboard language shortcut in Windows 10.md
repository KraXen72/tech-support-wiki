**NOTE:** This tutorial was created using Windows 10 October 2020 Update.

## First things first: There is more than one default Windows 10 change language shortcut
-   `Windows + Spacebar` - activates the next keyboard language or layout. This is the only Windows 10 change language shortcut you can not modify.
-   `Left Alt + Shift` - the default shortcut to change the keyboard language in Windows 10. It ignores other layouts you’re using for the same language.
-   `Ctrl + Shift` - switches between different keyboard layouts used for the same language. It only works if you added an alternative key configuration for the active language.

## How to access the Advanced Key Settings in Windows 10

To begin, [open Settings](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/introducing-windows-10-ways-open-settings/) and click or tap on *Devices*.

Click or tap on Input language hot keys

This opens the *“Advanced Key Settings”* tab of the *“Text Services and Input Languages”* window. All you need to change the keyboard language shortcut in Windows 10 is the *“Hot keys for input languages”* section, which takes up most of the window.

## Modify or disable the default keyboard shortcut to change language in Windows 10

In Windows 10, the change keyboard language shortcut is, by default, *Left Alt + Shift*. To switch between layouts, you use *Ctrl + Shift*. However, if you use the same hotkeys for another purpose, it’s easy to set another keyboard shortcut to change the language or layout.

In the *“Hot keys for input languages”* section, select the first option from the list, *“Between input languages*.*”* Then, click or tap on the *“Change Key Sequence”* button at the bottom.

This opens the *“Change Key Sequence”* pop-up window. The two panels in it offer alternative shortcuts to *“Switch Input Language”*(left) and *“Switch Keyboard Layout”* (on the right).

Unfortunately, you can only choose between the four preset options. Select *Not Assigned* to disable a shortcut, or press the *Grave Accent (\`)* to change the language or layout using just one key. Keep in mind that you can’t select the same keyboard shortcut for switching the input language and the keyboard layout. When you’re done, click or tap on *OK*.

Switch the keyboard language shortcut to another option and press OK

You are returned to the *Advanced Key Settings* tab. Press *OK* or *Apply* to confirm your changes once more.

Change the language keyboard shortcut and press OK or Apply

You can now use the new shortcut(s) you selected to switch between the available languages and layouts.

## Add a custom shortcut to change the keyboard language to a specific option

Multilingual users might add several keyboard languages and/or layouts to Windows 10. If you install too many options, switching between them using the default keyboard shortcuts can become time-consuming and confusing. Luckily, you can also set hotkeys to switch to specific languages or layouts you previously added.

In the *“Text Services and Input Languages”* window you opened earlier, select any layout from the *“Hot keys for input languages”* list and click or tap on *“Change Key Sequence*.*”*

![Select a layout and press Change Key Sequence](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/keyboard_shortcut-8.png.webp)

Select a layout and press Change Key Sequence

Next, make sure to check the *“Enable Key Sequence”* box, and you can use the two dropdown menus at the bottom. Compared to the switch keyboard language shortcut in the previous chapter, you get more flexibility when choosing the hotkeys for a specific language. The idea is to combine hotkeys from the first menu with keys from the second, creating different keyboard shortcuts for your favorite languages and layouts. Press on the left dropdown menu to reveal three possible options using modifier keys.

Check Enable Key Sequence to set a keyboard shortcut

Click or tap on the *Key* dropdown menu, which lists the number keys (from 0 to 9), the tilde (~) key, and the *Grave Accent* (\`) key. When you decide on the keyboard language shortcut you want to use, click or tap on *OK*.

**NOTE:** Our tests using the tilde and *Grave Accent* keys were not successful, so we recommend using the number keys during this step.

Set a keyboard shortcut to change the language to one you use the most

Confirm your choice once more by clicking *OK* or *Apply*.

![Confirm your choice to use the new shortcut](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/keyboard_shortcut-11.png.webp)

Confirm your choice to use the new shortcut

When you use the new keyboard shortcut, the language is changed at once to the corresponding one. To disable a custom shortcut, follow the same steps, but uncheck the *“Enable key sequence”* box in the *“Change Key Sequence”* window.
